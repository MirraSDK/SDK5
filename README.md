The primary focus of this plugin is to provide abstract interface for things like Ads, Payments, Analytics, Data, and many other tools which you use in development.

Choose providers for abstract interfaces, connect those plugins to MirraSDK, and have an advantage of simplicity over complexity by implementing MirraSDK API instead of concrete plugins.
