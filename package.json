  "description": "Crossplatform multipurpose plugin for Unity.\n\nAchieve automation and readability of your code by employing MirraSDK API as a replacement to many different plugins.\n\nThe primary focus of this plugin is to provide abstract interface for things like Ads, Payments, Analytics, Data, and many other tools which you use in development.\n\nChoose providers for abstract interfaces, connect those plugins to MirraSDK, and have an advantage of simplicity over complexity by implementing MirraSDK API instead of concrete plugins.\n\nCreated by romanlee17 from MirraGames.",
